# CRUD-API-with-Node.js
Building a Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

In this repo, we’ll be building a RESTful CRUD (signup,login,verify (verify account via email) ,socail_signup (facebook and gmail),forgot,reset_password) API with Node.js,
Express and MongoDB. We’ll use Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB instance.

Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js. It is built on top of node.js http module,
and adds support for routing, middleware, view system etc. It is very simple and minimal, unlike other frameworks that try do 
way to much, thereby reducing the flexibility for developers to have their own design choices.
